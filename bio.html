	<h2>A little about me</h2>

		<p> My name is Daniel, and I am a Junior at Tufts University. I'm studying computer science, but aside from that 
			I am passionate about music and improv comedy! Specifically I am into jazz, alternative rock, funk, and acoustic music. I've been playing the
			saxophone since middle school and I am in multiple music organizations at and outside of Tufts.
